                            online BCA admissions are typically based on either merit or entrance exams. To be eligible for online BCA admission, candidates must have achieved a minimum of 50% in their 10+2 or equivalent examination, with computer science or application as a core subject or supplementary course. In addition, a cumulative grade point average of at least 50% in Class 12, regardless of the field (Arts, Science, or Commerce), with English and mathematics as core subjects, is usually required. Some institutions may admit students who have not studied Math or English as compulsory subjects in high school. There is often no upper age limit for enrollment in an online BCA program. However, there is typically a minimum age requirement of 17 to 18 years for online BCA entrance.

        <p class="text-justify">
            The Distance MBA program, a two-year management study course or MBA degree correspondence course in India,
            is perfect for those who can’t make it to regular classes – and that’s why students love it.
            The study plan and length of a MBA distance course are pretty much like those of full-time MBAs,
            but the way you learn and the campus perks aren’t quite the same.
            In your distance MBA course, you’ll dive into big picture economics and the nitty-gritty of running a
            business,
            not to mention mastering corporate finance and other money matters.
            The instructional delivery for these courses adopts a hybrid format, with the possibility of weekend visits
            to the institute or designated centers.

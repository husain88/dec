                            A person can have a successful career path if makes an
                appropriate selection for the graduation degree. Students often
                face indecision while making this selection due to the
                availability of multiple options in different streams. However,
                they can resolve this pressing issue by conducting appropriate
                research to be aware of the curriculum of a course and prospects
                post the completion of the course.
                <br><br>
                B.com is one of the courses that may provide an aspired level of
                cognitive abilities and promising career prospects after its
                successful completion. An online B.com program provides an
                in-depth acquaintance with subjects like finance, business
                administration, accounting, taxation, etc. With the same, a
                student evolves cognitive abilities and prepares for the job or
                to handle the business as an entrepreneur.
                <br><br>
                Students who wish to obtain an online B.Com degree should pass
                their 10+2 and have a minimum of 50% marks to enroll. However,
                the marks criteria may vary depending on the university norms,
                and some universities may ask for a higher percentage or accept
                students with a lower percentage in their 10+2.
                <br><br>
                Unlike several other degrees, an online B.Com course does not go
                futile and offers students promising career options
                post-completion. Students may also embark on the path of higher
                education and may choose to pursue an M.Com or MBA post
                receiving their online B.Com degree.

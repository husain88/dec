                To accomplish the same, they employ a guided approach regarding
                academic curriculum, career prospects, history of the
                institution, syllabus, quality of faculty, and several other
                relevant factors that affect you directly or indirectly while

                do not lag in making reasonable choices due to lack of
                information or any information regarding a specific matter that
                is nebulous or students having no misconceptions regarding the
                course or the prospects post the completion of the course.

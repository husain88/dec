                        <br><br>
                        The University Grants Commission (UGC) has enacted strict regulations for colleges offering online learning programs in order to protect the quality of education and guarantee the validity of degrees earned.
                        <br><br>
                        In addition to providing a robust online learning infrast­ructure with digital study mater­ials, video lectures, and inter­active tools for student-professor intera­ctions, these online colleges in India offer a diverse range of programs.

                    </h3>
                    <p class="">
                        The University Grants Commission (UGC) was founded on December 28, 1953, and it was designated a statutory institution of the Government of India in 1956 by an Act of Parliament. The goal of this organization is to maintain standards for teaching, testing, and research in higher education while establishing norms and ensuring uniformity. UGC is currently thought of as a key pillar of higher education.

                        What is DEB?
                    </h3>
                    <p class="">
                        An organization or regulatory agency frequently connected to India’s education industry is the Distance Education Bureau (DEB). The organization is overseen by the Unive­rsity Grants Commi­ssion (UGC), which serves as the primary governing body for higher education in the country.
                        <br><br>
                        The Distance Education Bureau is essential in maintaining the caliber and standards of the distance learning programs provided by Indian colleges and institutions. By delivering educational programs and courses remotely, distance education enables students to learn without physically being present in a typical classroom setting. Online education, correspondence courses, and other distant teaching methods are frequently used in this modality of training.

                    </h1>
                    <p class="">
                        An education loan, as its name suggests, is money borrowed in order to finish one’s education. When a person pursues further education, they typically need an education loan. This is due to the fact that most higher degree course fees are extremely exorbitant and not everyone can afford them. 
                        <br><br>
                        Therefore, the issue of funding education is a significant worry for students today. The answer to this issue is to apply for an education loan from either public or commercial banks, or even from the universities themselves, who also provide a variety of financing options, such as fee-splitting into manageable EMIs.

                    Why Should One Take an Education Loan?
                </h3>
                <p class="">
                    Practically all students desire to attend the greatest colleges for a top-notch education. But one must spend a lot of money in order to acquire nice goods in life. Today, there isn’t easy money, thus it’s harder to keep this quality in our lives. Education institutions and funding organizations have therefore developed a method for supporting one’s education, namely by offering an education loan, in order to address this issue.

                    <p class="">
                        One of the main advantages of applying for an education loan is that they are relieved of the responsibility of paying the cost all at once. For a student and their parents, that is hectic. Additionally, even if students cannot afford a high course fee, they have the choice to follow a different course for the same cost, however, the payment procedure is somewhat different.

                    <p class="">
                        There is no pressure or deadline in the case of a school loan that requires us to pay the entire amount right away. With the aid of the simple EMI option, students may conveniently repay their education loan balance either after finishing their entire degree or when enrolled in it. These EMI alternatives can be created based on the student’s budget and criteria. Depending on their capabilities and criteria, they can create a 12-month EMI plan or a 24-month EMI plan.

                        If a student or loan application does not satisfy the eligibility criteria, they will not be offered the opportunity to apply for an education loan. The following conditions must be satisfied in order to qualify for an education loan:

                        Expenses Covered Under an Education Loan?
                    </h3>
                    <p class="">
                        There is a widespread misconception that an education loan only covers the tuition for the course for which it is being applied for. But it is untrue since over time, the education loan has also begun to pay for a number of supplementary costs. Let’s learn more about all the costs that are paid for by student loans. Below is a detailed description of the costs covered by an education loan:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-group effect-1 list-group-flush list-group-numbered">

                            <b>Course Tuition Fees</b>: It is one of the fundamental costs that an education loan will cover. A student has sought for a loan in the first place since it is a necessary requirement. Therefore, this expense is the most significant that is paid by any student loan.
                         </li>
                         <li class="list-group-item  border-0">
                             <b>Living Expenses</b>: Housing, food, transportation costs, and other living costs are included in the education budget. Because of this, the amount to which its expenses are covered may differ from bank to bank. Some may pay the entire cost of living, while others may just pay a portion of it. As a result, when applying for an education loan, one must carefully consider the loan coverage provided by a specific bank.
                          </li>
                          <li class="list-group-item  border-0">
                             <b>Study Expenses</b>:  In addition to tuition fee­s, education loans today often cover various othe­r study-related expe­nses such as research proje­cts, field trips, and additional resources. However, the alternatives for expense coverage vary from bank to bank. Even now, the majority of banks still do not pay for these costs. The fact that these costs are covered gives the student additional advantages while they are studying.
                          </li>
                          <li class="list-group-item  border-0">
                             <b>Travelling Expenses</b>: If one has filed for an education loan to pursue a course abroad, these costs are reimbursed. This covers every travel fee, including ticket costs and any other essential travel expenses. Travel expenditures are often not covered by the bank, but if you want them to be under your school loan, you must specifically state this when applying for the loan. Otherwise, the student loan will not pay for this expense.

                    <p class="">
                        Regarding how we would repay our loans, we were all confused. What basis would the loan balance be paid? Therefore, how our monthly Equivalent Monthly Installment (EMI) will be determined is a significant worry. Therefore, one might utilize an education loan EMI calculator to address this issue. 
                        <br><br>

                        Factors Considered Before Approving an Education Loan

                    <p class="">
                        When evaluating an education loan, loan lenders take a number of things into account. Among these elements are
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-group effect-1 list-group-flush list-group-numbered">

                            <b>Educational Institute and Course</b>: The applicant’s chosen course and educational institution are the first things a lender takes into account.

                         <li class="list-group-item  border-0">
                             <b>Loan Amount</b>: The next item on the list is the loan amount that a person requests; this is taken into consideration regardless of whether the lender would provide it or not.
                          </li>
                          <li class="list-group-item  border-0">
                             <b>Academic Performance</b>: When approving the loan application, the borrower’s past academic performance in classes is also taken into account. This is taken into account while evaluating the student’s ability.
                          </li>
                          <li class="list-group-item  border-0">
                             <b>Repayment Capability</b>: To give the lender confidence that the borrower can repay the loan in full or not, the repayment capacity of the individual or the individual’s family is also assessed. Family assets or security assets are also taken into account when approving a loan.
                          </li>
                          <li class="list-group-item  border-0">
                            <b>Annual Income</b>: When determining whether to approve the loan, the applicant’s family’s annual income is also taken into account.

                    <p class="">
                        Don’t compromise on your education because if you do, you’ll have to compromise on everything else for the rest of your life. It is preferable to use EMIs for a limited time to pay for schooling as opposed to making a lifetime EMI payment for a commodity. Instead of settling for less than you want in life, taking out an education loan can be a terrific way to get the education you want.
